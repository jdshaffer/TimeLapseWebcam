Version 1.0

2024-10-23

- Initial working version was completed.





---------------
Version 1.1
---------------
2024-11-11

- A "pause at night" feature was added to aid in creating more aesthetically appealing long-term (i.e., week-long) shots.





---------------
Version 1.1.1
---------------
2024-11-13

- Debugged the "pause at night" feature. It was written only to handle "pause across midnight" situations, but if you tried to pause simply during the day, the code logic failed.
- Added a little test to see if the pause_from time is less than the pause_until time (if yes, then same day, if no, then crosses midnight).
- Based on the results of that test, different "pause" logic is used.
- Also removed the "night" wording from the pausing variables. Perhaps someone might want to pause during the day for some reason. Simply calling them automatic_pause, pause_from, and pause_until now.

Version 1.2
---------------
2024-11-13

- Merged capture_timelapse.py with convert_to_movie.py, so now everything happens in one, simple program.
     - Added a few video-related configuration items
     - Copy-pasted in the the create_video_from_images function
     - Added a call to that function at the very end of the capture program.
- Added a "switch" in the configuration that lets the user turn on/off the automatic video creation 
     - Turning it ON creates an mp4 video from the captured images, but it also safely leaves 
       those images intact -- NO deleting! The user should decide to delete or keep the
       individual images, not the capture program.
- Tidied up the code a little and made the configuration section a bit easier to understand.
