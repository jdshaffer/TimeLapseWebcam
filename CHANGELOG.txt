Version 1.1.1
- Debugged the "pause at night" feature. It was written only to handle "pause across midnight" situations, but if you tried to pause simply during the day, the code logic failed.
- Added a little test to see if the pause_from time is less than the pause_until time (if yes, then same day, if no, then crosses midnight).
- Based on the results of that test, different "pause" logic is used.
- Also removed the "night" wording from the pausing variables. Perhaps someone might want to pause during the day for some reason. Simply calling them automatic_pause, pause_from, and pause_until now.
